assignment 2 - swiss poster design

# Intro:
My attempt at making a swiss poster.


### My Process / Development

- I used an example code from the slides and reverse-engineered use it for my own good.
- I honestly learned quite a bit in the reverse-engineering process, using it almost as my own DOM tree to figure out what exactly does what.
- After taking out what I didn't need & changing around the order of the header, main, and footer, I started to implement some of recenty learned CSS skills. 
- Specifically, taking advantage of the padding and margins and the various functions.


### Notes / Issues
- Had some trouble figuring out exactly which functions take what arguments/variables.
- Issues with the border arguments - still have an extra one at the top and not sure why. Couldn't add one at the very bottom.
- My footer functions have minds of their own
- I know the way I wrote my footer classes wasn't probably the most efficient way of doing that.
